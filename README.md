# Summary

This project stems from the **ECE 6699: Energy and Sustainability** course and focuses on **Conventional Electric Power Generation**. The overall objective is to analyze the current state and operational details of **fossil-fuel** and **nuclear** power plants, which continue to dominate global electricity generation despite the rise in renewable energy. The assignment is divided into two parts:

1. **Part 1 (20 pages or less)**  
   - **Technologies Covered:** Pulverized coal (dual unit), Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC), natural gas combustion turbines (conventional and advanced), combined cycles (conventional and advanced), diesel generation (MW scale), and nuclear reactors (pressurized and boiling water, dual unit).  
   - **Key Data Points:** Power cycle descriptions, operating temperatures, capacity ranges, efficiency, capacity factors, cooling needs, fuel sources and compositions, heat rate, emissions and their treatment, cost structures (capital, O&M), and waste management.

2. **Part 2 (10 pages or less)**  
   - **Further Analysis:** Factors influencing plant location and electricity price, notable projects worldwide, and discussion of future outlook for these conventional technologies.

By gathering, summarizing, and organizing these technical and economic data points, the project provides a comprehensive reference on **how conventional power plants operate, what they cost, and the main issues associated with their operation**.

# Description

The Project Report contains:

- **Research and Compilation:** A thorough examination of nine key conventional power generation technologies, exploring both fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, diesel) and nuclear reactors (PWR, BWR).  
- **Technical Specifications:** Detailed notes on thermodynamic cycles (Rankine, Brayton, Diesel, and combined), power plant capacity, fuel properties, and performance metrics (efficiency, capacity factor).  
- **Environmental & Economic Analysis:** Considerations around emissions (NOx, CO2, particulates), waste management (coal ash, nuclear waste), carbon capture, capital expenditures, and operating costs (fixed and variable).  
- **Industry Perspective:** Discussion on how site selection, fuel pricing, and global market factors shape the viability and future of each technology.

This documentation aims to be an accessible resource for **students and professionals** looking to understand the fundamentals and complexities of **conventional electric power generation**. By completing this project, I developed a holistic view of the **technical, environmental, and economic aspects** that underpin large-scale electricity production in both the USA and around the world.
